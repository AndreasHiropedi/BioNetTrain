# ezSTEP: an online platform for training and testing machine learning models for protein expression

## Introduction
ezSTEP (Sequence-to-expression Predictor) is the first machine-learning platform with a web-based user interface that enables the construction of automated machine-learning pipelines for computational analysis and predictions using regression.

## Accessibility
ezSTEP can be accessed in two different ways:

- our web app is hosted on the following server, which users can access using the following link:
